# Complete NodeJS Developer Course
### What is Node?

* The creators of Node took JavaScript and let it run on our machine in a stand-alone process. This means we don't need to use a browser
* Node and the JS that gets executed in a browser both run on **Chrome's V8 JavaScript Runtime Engine**
  * This engine compiles our JS code into faster, low-level machine code
  * This makes Node extremely fast
  * The V8 engine is built in C++
* Node vs the Browser
  * In the browser, the global object is called **window**
  * In node, the global object is called **global**
  * In the browser, we have the **document** object available
  * In node, we have the **process** object available

### Why Should I Use Node?

* Node uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
  * **Non-blocking I/O** - Multiple requests can be made without interference from each other
  * **Blocking** - all I/O actions happen in order; an action must be completed before the next one can be executed
  * **Non-blocking** - we start events by attaching callbacks; the callbacks can be executed at a later time
  * In node, the **event loop** attaches listeners for events to finish, then executes the callback function
  * Node is **single-threaded**; this means that our application runs on one, single thread
* Node.js' package ecosystem, **npm**, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world

## Node.js Fundamentals (Note App)
### Using Require
[Node.js Docs](http://nodejs.org/api)
  * Complete list of Node.js modules

* **Modules** are units of functionality
* **require** is a function that lets us load libraries/files in applications
* **app.js** - initialization file for application
* **const fs = require('fs');** - here, we are fetching all the contents of the 'fs' module and storing it within the constant 'fs'

### Requiring Your Own Files

* **module** - variable available in every node file
* **exports** - an object on the module property that allows us to store properties on the modules themselves
  * The real goal of **exports** is to be able to export **functions** we can use in other files
  * NOTE: if you use **arrow functions**, they will NOT bind the 'this' keyword  or **arguments array**
